# [VTM Photos](http://gif.berkeley.edu/vtmphotos)

A web application for exploring California landscape photos collected in the 1920s and 30s by the Wieslander Vegetation Type Mapping (VTM) project and some more recent reshoots taken of the same areas.


## Quick Start

The framework is based on [ngBoilerPlate](http://joshdmiller.github.io/ng-boilerplate/#/home), a kickstarter for building AngularJS projects. 
Install Node.js and then:


```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/berkeley-gif/vtmphoto
$ cd vtmphoto
$ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```

Finally, open `build/index.html` in your browser.
